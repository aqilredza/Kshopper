# Custom Requests Status Update Fix

## Problem
When admins update the status of custom requests, the update appears to succeed but reverts to "pending" when the page is refreshed.

## Root Cause
This issue is likely caused by one of the following:
1. Missing or incorrect Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `custom_requests` table
2. Database triggers that reset the status after updates
3. Functions that interfere with status updates

## Solution
Apply the database fixes using the SQL scripts provided.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Diagnose the Issue
First, run the diagnostic script to understand what's happening:
- Open `full_database_diagnostic_fixed.sql`
- Copy and paste the contents into your Supabase SQL Editor
- Run the script and review the output

### 2. Apply the Comprehensive Fix
Run the comprehensive fix script:
- Open `comprehensive_fix.sql`
- Copy and paste the contents into your Supabase SQL Editor
- Run the script

### 3. Verify the Fix
After applying the fix:
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Try updating a custom request status
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify that the status persists

## What the Fix Does

1. **Enables RLS** on the `custom_requests` table if not already enabled
2. **Creates proper policies** that allow:
   - Users to view their own requests
   - Users to insert their own requests
   - Users to update their own requests
   - Admins to view all requests
   - Admins to update all requests
   - Admins to delete requests
3. **Grants necessary permissions** to authenticated users
4. **Refreshes the database schema** to apply changes immediately

## Alternative Scripts

If you want to run specific checks:
- `check_table_structure_fixed.sql` - Check table structure and constraints
- `fix_custom_requests_rls_fixed.sql` - Apply only RLS fixes
- `simple_update_test.sql` - Simple test to verify update functionality

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, you should:
1. No longer see the "Status update may not have been applied correctly" error
2. Status updates should persist after page refresh
3. Both admin and user views should show the correct status

## If the Issue Persists

If the issue still occurs after applying the fix:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Run `full_database_diagnostic_fixed.sql` again to see if there are any triggers or functions interfering
3. Contact support with the diagnostic output
